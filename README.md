# Impact-of-Car-Features

This project shows the analysis of dataset titled "Car Features and MSRP" which contains information on various car models and their specifications.

## Problem :

How can a car manufacturer optimize pricing and product development decisions to maximize profitability while meeting consumer demand?

## Approach :
The main aim is to analyze the relationship between car's features, market category, and pricing, and identify which features and categories are most popular among consumers and most profitable for the manufacturer .




By using data analysis techniques such as regression analysis and market segmentation, the manufacturer could develop a pricing strategy that balances 
consumer demand with profitability, and identify which product features to focus on in future product development efforts.
This could help the manufacturer improve its competitiveness in the market and increase its profitability over time.
