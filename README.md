# Impact-of-Car-Features
This project shows the analysis of a dataset titled "Car Features and MSRP" which contains information on various car models and their specifications.

## Problem :
How can a car manufacturer optimize pricing and product development decisions to maximize profitability while meeting consumer demand?

## Approach :
The main aim is to analyze the relationship between a car's features, market category, and pricing, and identify which features and categories are most popular among consumers and most profitable for the manufacturer.
After understanding the data, I performed data cleaning, removed duplicate records, and handled missing data and inconsistent values. After that, I performed exploratory data analysis and found the highest popular categories, brands, average prices for different manufacturers, and how the price varies by other features. Then, I performed regression analysis to find the relationships between different features by calculating the correlation coefficient which will help the manufacturer to develop a pricing strategy that balances consumer demand with profitability and identify which product features to focus on in future product development efforts. This could help the manufacturer improve its competitiveness in the market and increase its profitability over time.

## Insights :
- The highest popular market categories are Hatchback, Flex Fuel; Flex Fuel, Diesel; and Crossover, Flex Fuel, Performance.
- Bugatti and Maybach are the highest-priced brands, while Plymouth and Oldsmobile are the lowest-priced brands.
- After performing regression analysis to identify the variables that have the strongest relationship with a car's price, it was observed that Engine HP has the strongest relationship with car price.
- The body style 4dr Hatchback has the highest fuel efficiency on highways.
- The Chevrolet brand has the highest total MSRP, and the Sedan body style has the highest total MSRP.
- Vehicles with more number of Engine cylinders typically have lower fuel efficiency on highways.

## Tech-Stack Used :
Tableau Public - Tableau Public is a free platform to explore, create, and publicly share data visualizations online. I have used this as it provides various features to create visually appealing charts.
